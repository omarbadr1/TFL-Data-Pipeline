# Transport for London (TFL) Data Pipeline

This is my final project submission for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025.  

## Problem Overview
Millions of people rely on buses and the Tube for their daily commutes across London. This project focuses on building a data pipeline to process Bus and Tube Usage data from 2019 to 2022, providing insights into commuting patterns by answering key analytical questions:
- Which days of the week have the highest ridership?  
- Do commuters prefer buses or the Tube?
- How frequently are buses and the Tube used on weekends?

## Data Set  
The dataset used in this project comes from TFL's online journeys data set (https://crowding.data.tfl.gov.uk/) and includes the following fields:  

- Travel Date  
- Day of Week
- Tube Journey Count 
- Bus Journey Count

## Technologies Used   
- **Docker** – Containerization  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code  
- **Kestra** – Workflow orchestration  
- **Google Cloud Storage** – Data lake  
- **BigQuery** – Data warehouse  
- **dbt** – Data transformation  
- **Looker Studio** – Data visualization
